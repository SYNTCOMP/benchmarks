The original `lily` tool synthesized _Moore_ systems.
All specifications in this folder contain the original properties, _but allow for synthesis of Mealy systems_.

This change affects the realizability of only one specification:
`lilydemo04.tlsf`, originally unrealizable (wrt. Moore machines) is now realiazable (because it is wrt. Mealy machines).
This folder provides two versions of `lilydemo04.tlsf`:
- `lilydemo04.tlsf` contains the original properties (but wrt. Mealy machines), it is realizable,
- `lilydemo04_modified.tlsf` modifies one property to make the specification unrealizable (wrt. Mealy machines).

If you are interested in the raw original versions of lily specifications,
use `TARGET: Moore` in all specifications.
